## Electronic Football Imitation App

In the 80s, there was a popular handheld electronic game called Mattel Electronic Football. I've done my best to recreate it into an iPhone app here. I used XCode with SwiftUI, and have distributed it to friends and family via TestFlight. I'm not sure it's worthy of the App Store, but maybe a later version will be!
